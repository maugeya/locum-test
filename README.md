## Project setup
- Clone the repo and type `yarn` in the terminal to install packages
- Start project with `yarn start`
- Project should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`

## If I had more time I would...
- Add a graphql server to avoid having to filter all the available shifts once the are returned
- Complete broken test (around checking isLoading is in state), had to leave it commented out so that the tests aren't broken but just ran out of time trying to fix it
- Add a filter to be able to filter locum shifts by hourly rate
- Add a button to be able to book a shift
- Add a new page to be able to see what shifts the user has already completed
- Formatting the dates correctly to make sure that overnight shifts show correctly
- More tests on making sure the right elements are rendering on the card and the general contents of the components.
- Add more styles to EVERYTHING!
